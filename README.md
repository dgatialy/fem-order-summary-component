## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox 
- Parcel
- Netlify

### What I learned

- This time I didn't recreate the design in Figma, but used it as a background to overlay the code. However, it turned out to be an advantage to start in Figma in order to be able to extract spacings and colors better later on.
- Fluid spacing and typography still seems to take work out of it. Instead of manually/absolutely defining the spacings and font sizes for different breakpoints. But this also means that pixel-perfect design was not possible with this. The look & feel is still maintained, though.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- [The Power of Composition with CSS Variables](https://blog.maximeheckel.com/posts/the-power-of-composition-with-css-variables/) Use CSS variables for colors in combination with alpha values.
